        A program that helps the computer perform tasks that usually require
        human assistance is known as Artificial Intelligence. It has made many
        tasks easier and is building its grip in the field of technology
        rapidly. This program is built by creating certain algorithms and
        statistical models that allow the computer to learn and make decisions
        based on the data.

            This category of artificial intelligence falls between the weak and
            strong spectrum of artificial intelligence. It is known for adapting
            and being flexible hence it can be used in a wide range of domains.
            It has abilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, and learning.

            This system still exists in concepts and is being worked upon to
            create a program that has all the abilities to perform any
            intellectual task that a human being can do. As scary as it may
            sound, there are possibilities that artificial intelligence might be
            able to replace human brains someday, but there is a long way before
            we get to witness that day.

        A subfield of artificial intelligence that builds algorithms and models
        which enable computers to learn and improve performance on a specific
        task is known as Machine Learning. This system is a process of training
        a machine to understand patterns in data and make decisions based on it.
        The computer uses data to create its own rules and models in this
        program.

          <b class="sub">Supervised Machine Learning:</b>
          <p class="paragraph">
            A type of machine learning in which the algorithm learns from the
            labeled data and the answers and correct outputs are already known
            is known as supervised machine learning. The algorithm usually
            adjusts the parameters to minimize the differences between the
            predicted and actual outputs. Supervised learning is used in a wide
            range of tasks like linear regression, logistic regression, and
            support vector machines.

        <li>
          <b class="sub">Unsupervised Machine Learning: </b>
          <p class="paragraph">
            It is the opposite of supervised machine learning as the algorithm
            learns from the unlabeled data where neither outputs nor any
            categories are known. The usual task of unsupervised machine
            learning is to find patterns in the data without any prior knowledge
            of the correct labels or answers. It is used in fields such as image
            and speech recognition, natural language processing, and anomaly
            detection.

          <b class="sub">Reinforced Machine Learning:</b>
          <p class="paragraph">
            A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make the
            decisions through trial and error method is known as Reinforcement
            Machine learning. Its goal is to learn a policy, or set of rules
            that tells how an agent should behave to maximize the rewards. This
            learning also involves the process of exploitation and exploration,
            where the agent tries different methods and chooses what is best. It
            is used in various fields such as robotics, game playing, and
            autonomous vehicles.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Machine learning has a wide variety of applications, including image
        recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection, natural language
        processing, and more. As the data eventually becomes increasingly
        abundant, the potential uses of machine learning are expanding along
        with it.
