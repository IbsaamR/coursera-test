    <p>
      They say that money changes everything. Most people trade 40 hours of
      their time every week for an allotment of it. The lure of getting rich
      spurred thousands of adventurous speculators to travel clear across the
      United States to stake their claim in the California Gold Rush. Investment
      markets nervously await the news from the Federal Reserve meetings.And
      then there is the latest money craze – Bitcoin. While Bitcoin steals most
      of the headlines, it is just one of many digital currencies, also referred
      to as cryptocurrencies, out there today. In this article we will take a
      closer look at what cryptocurrencies are, how they are produced and what
      you can do with them.

        <strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> is a decentralized digital currency. It
        does not exist in physical form like traditional money so you can’t
        carry it in your pocket or purse. It is made up of blocks of encrypted
        data and is exchanged through a secure peer-to-peer file transfer
        system. Its supply and value are depended upon the activities of the
        users themselves along with complex protocols built into the coding
        system that provides the governing structure that cannot be easily
        modified. It is decentralized in that it operates without any government
        oversight or intervention. Because of this, cryptocurrencies don’t have
        banks, nor are they backed by anything like the Federal Deposit
        Insurance Corporation (FDIC) which backs the U.S. dollar. There isn’t a
        traditional mint creating these currencies either. In fact,
        cryptocurrencies are created by independent miners who are rewarded for
        their efforts.

        In order to create dollar bills, you need some type of printer. In order
        to generate cryptocurrency, you need a computer. We commonly use the
        term, “coin” when talking cryptocurrency denomination, but it is a
        relative term.<br />

        New coins are generated, or “mined” by a network node each time it
        solves a specific and difficult mathematical problem. The involved
        equations become more complex as more coins are mined. In technical
        terms, mining involves calculating the hash of a block header. This
        header includes a reference to the previous block, a hash of a set of
        transactions and a unique 32-bit value called a “nonce”. The creation of
        the coins is recorded in a ledger called a blockchain.<br />

        If you want to be a cryptocurrency miner, be prepared to spend some
        money. Any traditional mining project, whether it be gold or some other
        mineral requires considerable investment. Cryptomining is no different.
        For a popular cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, the days of mining it on
        your home PC are long gone. It takes a lot of computing power to mine
        these coins today.<br />

        It also takes a lot of energy to not only power the mining hardware but
        also cool down these large servers with industrial grade cooling
        systems. The cost of electricity alone is a big reason why it is
        difficult to actually make money anymore mining Bitcoin. For this
        reason, the majority of mining takes place in countries such as China
        where electricity is inexpensive and where large “farms” of high end
        computers operate around the clock.<br />A more unscrupulous mining
        method involves cryptocurrency mining malware. Dishonest miners
        distribute malware throughout the world to infect unsuspecting users.
        Once a device is infected with the malicious code, it begins using the
        CPU and memory resources of its hardware host to collectively mine a
        designated cryptocurrency.<br />

        While a single client device has nowhere near the capacity to mine
        cryptocurrency to any reasonable degree, the collective effort of
        thousands of devices can. A compromised computer is called a zombie.
        Hackers who control these zombie armies of miners are ringing in profits
        on the backs of others. The proliferation of crypto mining malware
        fluctuates with the price of the currencies.
